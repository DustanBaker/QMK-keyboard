# QMK-keyboard
This repository is for programmable keyboard firmware and coding projects. 
I have started building keyboard hardware and software. 
The hardware is currently a nullbitsco tidbit

To compile the files into a .hex file download and use qmk msys https://msys.qmk.fm/
type in the command line
qmk compile -kb manufacturer/product -km folder  
if there are any errors they will be displayed in the compiler.
then use the qmk toolbox https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases to flash the device. You will need to reset the keyboard before flashing. 





My own projects are geared torwards helping me be more proficant at work. By setting up macros to auto fill shipping forms and other repetitive tasks it has increased my productivity by a wide margin. 
Future projects will be more ambitious in scope, but for now i am working to get this Tidbit numberpad fully operational.
